<p>这是一首灰常有意思的歌曲，翻唱自Julia Ecklar的"God Lives on Terra"。</p>

<p>可以看看这里了解一下这首歌曲的歌词：<a href="http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.html">http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.html</a></p>

<p>GNU社区还推荐了很多有意思的东东，可以去<a href="http://www.gnu.org/fun/humor.html">http://www.gnu.org/fun/humor.html</a>查看，作为一个Linuxer和一个Programmer，这些内容可算是相当不错的休闲佐料了～</p>

<p>顺便试一下WP的1bit插件：<a href="http://www.prometheus-music.com/audio/eternalflame.mp3">eternal－flame</a></p>

<p>囧，居然不支持ogg格式的播放……传个MP3格式的算了，ogg格式下载<a href="http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.ogg">点此</a>。</p>

<p>附上歌词一览：</p>

<p><!--more-->
<blockquote>I was taught assembler<br />
in my second year of school.<br />
It's kinda like construction work --<br />
with a toothpick for a tool.<br />
So when I made my senior year,<br />
I threw my code away,<br />
And learned the way to program<br />
that I still prefer today.</blockquote></p>

<p>Now, some folks on the Internet<br />
put their faith in C++.<br />
They swear that it's so powerful,<br />
it's what God used for us.<br />
And maybe it lets mortals dredge<br />
their objects from the C.<br />
But I think that explains<br />
why only God can make a tree.</p>

<p>For God wrote in Lisp code<br />
When he filled the leaves with green.<br />
The fractal flowers and recursive roots:<br />
The most lovely hack I've seen.<br />
And when I ponder snowflakes,<br />
never finding two the same,<br />
I know God likes a language<br />
with its own four-letter name.</p>

<p>Now, I've used a SUN under Unix,<br />
so I've seen what C can hold.<br />
I've surfed for Perls, found what Fortran's for,<br />
Got that Java stuff down cold.<br />
Though the chance that I'd write COBOL code<br />
is a SNOBOL's chance in Hell.<br />
And I basically hate hieroglyphs,<br />
so I won't use APL.</p>

<p>Now, God must know all these languages,<br />
and a few I haven't named.<br />
But the Lord made sure, when each sparrow falls,<br />
that its flesh will be reclaimed.<br />
And the Lord could not count grains of sand<br />
with a 32-bit word.<br />
Who knows where we would go to<br />
if Lisp weren't what he preferred?</p>

<p>And God wrote in Lisp code<br />
Every creature great and small.<br />
Don't search the disk drive for man.c,<br />
When the listing's on the wall.<br />
And when I watch the lightning burn<br />
Unbelievers to a crisp,<br />
I know God had six days to work,<br />
So he wrote it all in Lisp.</p>

<p>Yes, God had a deadline.<br />
So he wrote it all in Lisp.</p>
