<p>最近忙着考试复习，第三次错过了第一时间发布（至少是同步发布）消息的时机，sigh~</p>

<p><blockquote>The Wine team is proud to announce that Wine 1.0 is now available. This is the first stable release of Wine after 15 years of development and beta testing. Many thanks to everybody who helped us along that long road!</blockquote></p>

<p>While compatibility is not perfect yet, thousands of applications have been reported to work very well. Check http://appdb.winehq.org to see the details for your favorite applications.</p>

<p>The source is available now. Binary packages are in the process of being built, and will appear soon at their respective download locations.</p>

<p>15年，赞毅力，别的不说了，嗯。</p>
