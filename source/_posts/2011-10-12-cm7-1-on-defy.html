<p>CyanogenMod, the community Android mod, is officially <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/blog/cyanogenmod-7-1-released" target="_blank">supporting Motorlora Defy</a> in the latest release CM7.1. Now the system seems running well on my device.</p>

<p>Why I want CM7.1 on my machine:</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>try something new</li>
	<li>I need openvpn</li>
	<li>2.3.4 ROM for ME525+ not working well on my device :-(</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I followed most of the instructions from <a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/32469-cyanogenmod-7-for-the-motorola-defy-v710-9-oct-2011/" target="_blank">the post in CM forum</a>, except that I didn't install gapps-gb-20110828. For some reason, <em>Android Market</em> from 20110828 package continously got crashed once I opened the application. I tried with <a href="http://goo-inside.me/gapps/gapps-gb-20110613-signed.zip" target="_blank">gapps-gb-20110613</a> and <em>Android Market</em> worked as normal, so I recommend using this version of gapps if you ever encountered similar issue like me.</p>

<p><!--more-->Well... Some extra jibber-jabbers about <em>Android Market</em>:</p>

<p>Region restriction sucks... It prevents me from buying Touchdown license from market...</p>

<p>I do hate <a href="http://twidroyd.com/" target="_blank">some</a> apps changing their names so frequently and deprecating the old version in market. I PAID for the old one, and I still need to pay for the new one!</p>
